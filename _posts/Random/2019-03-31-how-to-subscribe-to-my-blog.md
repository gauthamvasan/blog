<h3>SUBSCRIBE</h3>
<p align="justify"> This site syndicates content via RSS (Really Simple Syndication) â€” which is an XML-based format for sharing and distributing Web content. Using an RSS reader, you can view data feeds from various news sources and blog sites in a central location. </p>

<h3>How So I Sign Up For RSS Feeds? What is an RSS Reader?</h3>
<p align="justify"> To subscribe to RSS feeds, you need an RSS Reader (or Feed/News Aggregator). These programs (and services) will download and display RSS feeds for you. A number of free and commercial News Aggregators are available for download. Personally, I use <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a>. If you'd like to setup an RSS feed for your own jekyll-based github page, read this <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages">post</a>.  </p>

<h3> What Are The RSS Feed(s) For This Site? </h3>
