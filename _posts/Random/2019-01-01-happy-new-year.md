<p align="justify"> We humans are a strange species. We come up with weird excuses to party and have fun. Every year, we celebrate Earth completing it's orbit around the Sun. I love it! There's a rekindled sense of optimism in the air. It gives us time to reflect over the last 12 months and take stock of our life. A nice checkpoint in what would hopefully be an amazing life :) </p>  

<p align="justify"> It's been a great year with a lot of ups and downs, of highs and lows. It tested my sanity, strengthened my resolve and made me truly appreciate the value of friends and family. It truly was a landmark year that would forever remain close to my heart. Here's to a year that has given me a lot, that has probably taken more, but overall a year that has been my biggest learning curve yet. I'm grateful for it all. Eternally indebted to a lot of people in my life for their kindness and affection. A special shoutout to the following things and people in my life: </p>

* The amazing Kindred team (especially my colleagues James, Rupam and Dima) - The AI Research team is awesome! Great, down-to-earth colleagues, quality work and a nurturing work environment. They've helped me grow a lot as a researcher. 
* One of my closest friends SV (Vignesh Sk) - One of the kindest, smartest, wackiest guys I know. Talks openly from his heart, completely candid and most importantly, a great friend :) If not for him and my work at Kindred, I shudder to imagine how my life could've turned out this year.    
* Naresh, Raam, Boxer and TSB - My long time friends from NIT. My comrades in arms. Always grateful to our inane, funny and sometimes deeply philosophical conversations.
* PV (Vignesh Pasupathy) - This guy is the definition of smart, unassuming and humble. While we don't talk as often as we should, we've got a great thing going. The conversation starts where we left off previously :) 
* Francois Hogan - Had an amazing time working with him during his internship at Kindred. Super smart, digs deep until he truly understands what he studies, runs marathons and always smiling and humble :) Unfortunate that he had to go back to MIT to finish his PhD :)
* Pooja, Asmini and Megan - Hard to describe, some wonderful memories.
* Vishaal and Ramkumar - Some of my oldest friends from high school. Super smart, fun guys to hangout with! They're both living in Pittsburgh (roommates) and pursuing a PhD. I had a blast hanging out with them in Sept this year!
* Sharath Anna - A cousin who's life experiences would blow your mind! Never got a chance to spend time with him until this year. Great guy who I'd love to josh around with more often.
* Rajan uncle - My Dad's closest friend. Another guy who's life experiences, tastes and ideas impressed the hell out of me. Kind, funny and unassuming :) The trip to Vellore to meet him would always be close to my heart :) 
* Honorable mentions - Navaneeth, Sanket, Megha, Jeremy, Simge, Dieta, Bala, Lalith and Siddharth Balan for being in my life. Yoga classes with Alejandra. Colin (intern at Kindred) for exhibiting true emotional strength.    
* Paati, Senthil, Nathan and Rajesh Chithappa, Anitha Chithi, Sriram, Karthik and Varshini - For their genuine love and concern for me :)  
* Srinath - My brother who puts up with all the weird shit I say. He's currently studying in Sweden. I'm sure he's going to do great things in life :)
* Amma and Appa - Eternally indebted to their unconditional love. I do debate with them a lot just for the sake of it :P They really did let me live life on my own terms.
