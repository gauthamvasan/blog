<p align="justify"> An excerpt from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a> that is definitely worth rereading and remembering. It's important to note that Richard Feynman lambasted the university education system of Brazil in the early 50s. Sadly, all these criticisms hold true in modern day India (even in premier technical institutes). I really really hope this is fixed in the next couple of decades. </p>

<blockquote>
    
  <p align="justify">In regard to education in Brazil, I had a very interesting  experience.
I was  teaching  a  group of  students who would ultimately become teachers,
since at that time there were not many opportunities in Brazil for a  highly
trained person in  science. These students had already had many courses, and
this was to be their most advanced  course  in  electricity and magnetism –
Maxwell’s equations, and so on.</p>

  <p align="justify">The university was  located in various office  buildings throughout the
city, and the course I taught met in a building which overlooked the bay.</p>

  <p align="justify">I discovered a very  strange phenomenon: I could ask  a question, which
the students would  answer  immediately. But the next time I  would  ask the
question  – the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could tell
–  they couldn’t  answer it  at all! For instance, one  time I  was talking
about polarized light, and I gave them all some strips of polaroid.</p>

  <p align="justify">Polaroid  passes  only  light  whose electric vector is  in  a  certain
direction, so  I explained  how  you  could  tell which  way  the  light  is
polarized from whether the polaroid is dark or light.</p>

  <p align="justify">We first took two strips  of polaroid and  rotated them until  they let
the most light through.  From doing that we could tell that  the two  strips
were  now admitting  light polarized  in the  same direction  – what passed
through one piece of polaroid could also pass through  the other. But then I
asked them how one  could tell the <i>absolute</i> direction of polarization, for a
<i>single</i> piece of polaroid.</p>

  <p align="justify">They hadn’t any idea.</p>

  <p align="justify">I knew this took a certain amount of ingenuity, so I gave them  a hint:
“Look at the light reflected from the bay outside.”</p>

  <p align="justify">Nobody said anything.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then I said, “Have you ever heard of Brewster’s Angle?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“Yes, sir! Brewster’s Angle is the angle  at which light reflected from
a medium with an index of refraction is completely polarized.”</p>

  <p align="justify">“And which way is the light polarized when it’s reflected?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“The light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflection, sir.”
Even now, I  have to  think about it; they knew it cold! They  even knew the
tangent of the angle equals the index!</p>

  <p align="justify">I said, “Well?”</p>

  <p align="justify">Still nothing. They had just told me that light reflected from a medium
with an index, such as the bay outside, was polarized; they had even told me
which <i>way</i> it was polarized.</p>

  <p align="justify">I said, “Look at the bay outside, through the  polaroid.  Now  turn the
polaroid.”</p>

  <p align="justify">“Ooh, it’s polarized!” they said.</p>

  <p align="justify">After a lot of investigation,  I finally  figured out that the students
had memorized everything,  but they didn’t  know what  anything  meant. When
they  heard  “light that  is  reflected from a  medium with an index,”  they
didn’t know that it meant  a material  <i>such as water</i>. They  didn’t know that
the “direction  of the light” is  the  direction in which  you <i>see</i> something
when you’re looking at it, and so on. Everything was entirely memorized, yet
nothing had been translated into meaningful words. So  if I asked,  “What is
Brewster’s Angle?” I’m  going into the computer with the right keywords. But
if I  say, “Look at  the water,” nothing happens – they don’t have anything
under “Look at the water”!</p>

  <p align="justify">Later I attended a lecture  at the engineering school. The lecture went
like   this,  translated  into  English:   “Two   bodies…  are  considered
equivalent…  if equal torques…  will  produce… equal acceleration. Two
bodies,  are  considered  equivalent, if equal torques,  will  produce equal
acceleration.” The  students were  all sitting  there  taking dictation, and
when the professor repeated the  sentence, they checked it to make sure they
wrote it down all right. Then they wrote down the next sentence,  and on and
on. I was the only one who knew the professor was talking about objects with
the same moment of inertia, and it was hard to figure out.</p>

  <p align="justify">I  didn’t see how they were going to  learn anything from that. Here he
was talking about moments  of inertia, but there was no discussion about how
hard it is  to push a door open when you  put heavy  weights on the outside,
compared to when you put them near the hinge – <i>nothing</i>!</p>

  <p align="justify">After the lecture, I talked to  a student: “You take all those notes –
what do you do with them?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“Oh, we study them,” he says. “We’ll have an exam.”</p>

  <p align="justify">“What will the exam be like?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“Very easy.  I  can tell you now one of the questions.” He looks at his
notebook and  says, “ ‘When are two bodies equivalent?’  And the answer  is,
‘Two  bodies are considered equivalent if  equal torques will produce  equal
acceleration.’ “ So,  you see, they could pass the examinations, and “learn”
all  this stuff,  and  not  <i>know</i>  anything  at  all,  except what  they  had
memorized.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then  I  went  to  an  entrance  exam  for  students  coming  into  the
engineering school.  It was an oral exam, and I was allowed to listen to it.
One  of the students was absolutely super: He answered everything nifty! The
examiners asked him what diamagnetism  was,  and he  answered  it perfectly.
Then they asked, “When light comes  at  an angle through a sheet of material
with a certain thickness, and a certain index N, what happens to the light?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“It comes out parallel to itself, sir – displaced.”</p>

  <p align="justify">“And how much is it displaced?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“I  don’t know, sir, but I can figure it out.” So he figured it out. He
was very good. But I had, by this time, my suspicions.</p>

  <p align="justify">After the exam I went up to this bright young man, and explained to him
that I was from  the  United  States, and that  I  wanted  to  ask him  some
questions that would  not  affect the result of his examination in  any way.
The first question I ask is, “Can you  give me some example of a diamagnetic
substance?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“No.”</p>

  <p align="justify">Then I  asked, “If  this book was made of glass,  and I was  looking at
something  on the table  through it,  what would  happen  to the  image if I
tilted the glass?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“It would be  deflected, sir, by twice the angle that you’ve turned the
book.”</p>

  <p align="justify">I said, “You haven’t got it mixed up with a mirror, have you?”</p>

  <p align="justify">“No, sir!”</p>

  <p align="justify">He had  just  told me  in  the  examination  that  the  light  would be
displaced, parallel to itself,  and therefore  the image  would move over to
one side, but would  not be turned by any angle. He had even figured out how
<i>much</i> it would be displaced, but he didn’t realize that a piece of glass is a
material with an index, and that his calculation had applied to my question.</p>

  <p align="justify">I taught a course at the engineering school  on mathematical methods in
physics, in which I tried to show how to solve problems by trial  and error.
It’s something  that people don’t usually learn, so I began with some simple
examples of arithmetic  to illustrate  the method. I was surprised that only
about eight out of the eighty or so students turned in the first assignment.
So I gave a strong lecture  about having  to  actually <i>try</i> it, not just  sit
back and watch <i>me</i> do it.</p>

  <p align="justify">After  the lecture some students came up to me in a little  delegation,
and told me that  I  didn’t understand the backgrounds that they  have, that
they can study  without doing the problems,  that they have already  learned
arithmetic, and that this stuff was beneath them.</p>

  <p align="justify">So  I kept  going with  the  class, and  no matter  how  complicated or
obviously  advanced the work  was becoming,  they  were never handing a damn
thing in. Of course I realized what it was: They couldn’t <i>do</i> it!</p>

  <p align="justify">One  other  thing I  could  never get them to do was to ask  questions.
Finally, a student explained it to  me: “If  I ask you a question during the
lecture, afterwards everybody will be telling me, ‘What are you wasting  our
time for in the class? We’re trying to <i>learn</i> something.  And you’re stopping
him by asking a question’.”</p>

  <p align="justify">It was a kind of one-upmanship, where nobody knows what’s going on, and
they’d put  the other one  down as if they <i>did</i> know. They all fake that they
know, and if one student admits  for a moment that something is confusing by
asking a question, the others take a high-handed attitude, acting as if it’s
not confusing at all, telling him that he’s wasting their time.</p>

  <p align="justify">I  explained  how  useful it  was  to  work together,  to  discuss  the
questions, to talk it over, but they  wouldn’t do that either,  because they
would  be losing face if they had to  ask someone else. It  was pitiful! All
the work they did, intelligent  people,  but they got  themselves  into this
funny state of mind, this strange kind of self-propagating “education” which
is meaningless, utterly meaningless!</p>

  <p align="justify">At the end of the academic year, the students asked me to  give a  talk
about my experiences of teaching in  Brazil. At the talk there would be  not
only students,  but professors  and government  officials, so  I  made  them
promise that  I could say whatever  I wanted.  They said, “Sure.  Of course.
It’s a free country.”</p>

  <p align="justify">So I came in,  carrying the elementary physics textbook that they  used
in the  first year of  college.  They thought  this book was especially good
because  it had  different kinds  of  typeface –  bold  black  for the most
important things to remember, lighter for less important things, and so on.</p>

  <p align="justify">Right  away somebody said, “You’re not  going to say anything bad about
the textbook, are you? The  man  who  wrote it is here, and everybody thinks
it’s a good textbook.”</p>

  <p align="justify">“You promised I could say whatever I wanted.”</p>

  <p align="justify">The  lecture  hall was full. I started  out by  defining science  as an
understanding of the  behavior of  nature.  Then  I asked, “What  is a  good
reason for teaching  science?  Of course,  no  country can  consider  itself
civilized unless… yak, yak,  yak.”  They  were all sitting there  nodding,
because I know that’s the way they think.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then I say, “That, of course, is absurd, because  why should we feel we
have to keep up with another country? We have to do it for a <i>good</i> reason,  a
<i>sensible</i> reason; not just because other countries do.”  Then  I talked about
the utility of science, and its contribution to the improvement of the human
condition, and all that – I really teased them a little bit.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then I say, “The main purpose of my talk is to  demonstrate to you that
<i>no</i> science is being taught in Brazil!”</p>

  <p align="justify">I can see them stir, thinking,  “What? No  science? This  is absolutely
crazy! We have all these classes.”</p>

  <p align="justify">So I tell them that one of the first things to strike me when I came to
Brazil was  to  see  elementary  school kids  in bookstores, buying  physics
books. There are so  many  kids  learning physics  in Brazil, beginning much
earlier than kids do  in the United States, that it’s amazing you don’t find
many physicists in Brazil – why is that? So many kids are working  so hard,
and nothing comes of it.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then  I  gave  the  analogy of  a Greek scholar  who  loves  the  Greek
language,  who knows  that in  his  own country there  aren’t  many children
studying Greek. But he comes to another country, where  he  is  delighted to
find  everybody studying Greek – even the smaller  kids  in the  elementary
schools. He goes to  the examination of  a student who is coming  to get his
degree  in  Greek,  and   asks  him,  “What  were  Socrates’  ideas  on  the
relationship between Truth  and Beauty?”  – and  the  student can’t answer.
Then he asks  the  student, “What did  Socrates say  to Plato  in  the Third
Symposium?” the student lights up and goes, “Brrrrrrrrr-up”  – he tells you
everything, word for word, that Socrates said, in beautiful Greek.</p>

  <p align="justify">But what Socrates was talking  about  in the  Third  Symposium  was the
relationship between Truth and Beauty!</p>

  <p align="justify">What this  Greek scholar discovers  is, the students in another country
learn Greek by first learning to pronounce the letters,  then the words, and
then sentences and paragraphs. They can recite, word for word, what Socrates
said, without  realizing that those Greek words actually <i>mean</i>  something. To
the student they are all  artificial sounds. Nobody has ever translated them
into words the students can understand.</p>

  <p align="justify">I said, “That’s  how it looks to me,  when I  see you teaching the kids
‘science’ here in Brazil.” (Big blast, right?)</p>

  <p align="justify">Then I  held up the elementary physics textbook they were using. “There
are no experimental results mentioned anywhere in this book, except  in  one
place where there is  a ball, rolling down an  inclined plane, in  which  it
says how  far the ball got after one second, two seconds, three seconds, and
so on. The numbers  have ‘errors’ in them – that is,  if you look at  them,
you think you’re looking at experimental results, because the numbers  are a
little above, or a little below, the theoretical values. The book even talks
about having to  correct the experimental errors –  very  fine. The trouble
is, when  you calculate the value  of the  acceleration constant  from these
values, you get the right answer. But a ball rolling down an inclined plane,
<i>if it is  actually done</i>, has an inertia to  get it to turn, and will, <i>if you
do the experiment</i>, produce five-sevenths of the right answer, because of the
extra  energy needed to go  into the rotation of  the ball.  Therefore  this
single example of experimental ‘results’ is obtained from <i>a fake experiment</i>.
Nobody  had rolled  such  a  ball,  or  they would  never have gotten  those
results!</p>

  <p align="justify">“I have discovered something else,” I continued. “By flipping the pages
at random, and putting my finger in  and reading the sentences on that page,
I can show you what’s the matter – how it’s not science, but memorizing, in
<i>every</i> circumstance. Therefore I am brave enough  to  flip  through the pages
now, in front of this audience, to  put  my finger in, to read, and to  show
you.”</p>

  <p align="justify">So I did it. <i>Brrrrrrrup – I</i> stuck my finger in, and I started to read:
“Triboluminescence. Triboluminescence is the light emitted when crystals are
crushed…”</p>

  <p align="justify">I said, “And there, have you got science? No! You have only told what a
word means in terms  of other words. You haven’t  told anything about nature
– <i>what</i> crystals produce light  when you crush them, <i>why</i> they produce light.
Did you see any student go home and <i>try</i> it? He can’t.</p>

  <p align="justify">“But if, instead, you were to write, ‘When you take a lump of sugar and
crush it with a pair of pliers in the dark, you can see a bluish flash. Some
other  crystals do  that too. Nobody  knows  why. The  phenomenon is  called
“triboluminescence.” ‘ Then someone will go home and try it. Then there’s an
experience of nature.” I used that example to show them,  but it didn’t make
any  difference  where I would have  put my finger in the book;  it was like
that everywhere.</p>

  <p align="justify">Finally, I said  that I  couldn’t see how anyone could  be  educated by
this self-propagating system in which people pass exams, and teach others to
pass exams, but nobody knows  anything. “However,” I said, “I must be wrong.
There  were two  Students in my  class  who  did very well,  and  one of the
physicists I know was educated entirely in Brazil. Thus, it must be possible
for some people to work their way through the system, bad as it is.”</p>

  <p align="justify">Well,  after  I  gave the  talk,  the  head  of  the  science education
department got up  and said, “Mr. Feynman has  told  us some things that are
very hard for us to hear, but it appears to be that he really loves science,
and is sincere in his criticism. Therefore, I think we should listen to him.
I came here knowing we have some sickness in our system of education; what I
have learned is that we have a cancer!” – and he sat down.</p>

  <p align="justify">That gave  other people  the freedom to speak out, and  there was a big
excitement. Everybody was getting up and making  suggestions.  The  students
got some  committee together to mimeograph the lectures in advance, and they
got other committees organized to do this and that.</p>

  <p align="justify">Then something happened which was totally unexpected for me. One of the
students  got up  and  said, “I’m  one  of the two students whom Mr. Feynman
referred to  at  the end of  his  talk. I was not educated in  Brazil; I was
educated in Germany, and I’ve just come to Brazil this year.”</p>

  <p align="justify">The other student who  had  done well in class had  a similar thing  to
say. And the professor I had mentioned got up and said, “I was educated here
in Brazil during the war, when, fortunately, all of the professors  had left
the university, so  I learned  everything by  reading alone. Therefore I was
not really educated under the Brazilian system.”</p>

  <p align="justify">I didn’t expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100 percent –  it
was terrible!</p>

  <p align="justify">Since  I had  gone to Brazil under  a program sponsored  by the  United
States  Government, I was asked by the  State Department to  write  a report
about my  experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the speech
I had just given. I found out later through the grapevine  that the reaction
of somebody in the State Department was, “That shows you how dangerous it is
to  send somebody to  Brazil who is so  naive.  Foolish fellow; he can  only
cause trouble.  He  didn’t understand the problems.” Quite  the contrary!  I
think this person in the State Department was naive to think that because he
saw a university with  a list of courses  and  descriptions, that’s what  it
was.</p>
