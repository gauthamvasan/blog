<blockquote> “Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies." <br>

<p align="justify"> Have you ever been devoid of hope? Do you know what it feels lost and completely alone? It's not a good feeling to say the least. Maybe it's just a small part of the human experience. But it does leave a bitter after-taste. I didn't realize how powerful that quote was until I experienced utter hopelessness. </p>

<p align="justify"> Hope is a huge driving force in our lives. Regardless of how shitty the situation is, hope can show us the light at the end of the tunnel. When I look back at some of the best times of my life, I can't help but smile at how hopeful and optimistic I was. If you were to ask any of my friends or folks who've worked with me, they'd tell you that I'm cheerful, energetic and generally positive. Atleast I used to be. I love it when I'm super optimistic. I'd be zestful, overflowing with ideas, curious about everything, humourous, fun to be around, etc. </p>

<p align="justify"> I haven't been consistently optimistic for quite a while now. Slowly, over the years, I've grown to be a jaded, cynical person. I'm still hopeful about the future. But I'm quite pessimistic and unsatisfied with the present. If someone asks me what happened, all I could muster right now is "life happened". I had more exposure. I saw a large proportion of people act only in their own self-interest. A new found clarity helped me look at the life my parents and relatives led without any filters. It became crystal clear that life wasn't some game with pre-defined rules and scoring systems. You get to choose your own path and be satisfied with it. Hence, the inevitable analysis paralysis resulting from the paradox of choice. For the last 1.5 years, I've had a good professional life, but my personal life took some severe hits. Partly my own fault, partly unlucky. Nevertheless, I was floundering for a bit, made some futile attempts to escape reality and was unhappy for quite a while. I've finally learned to live with myself and deal with the pain in a healthy fashion. </p>

<p align="justify"> After a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found that I need a bit of irrationality to stay sane. Time after time, when all logic points to a disappointing outcome, a small, irrational voice inside my head asks me to believe and persevere. And it has been right quite a lot. I like swinging for the fences, I like moonshot ideas. I feel alive when I do those things. It's just a fantastic feeling when you reach for the stars and actually make it. And I just can't see how I could ever do any of that as a pessimist. Fuck that, I want to keep working towards a life I belive would get better and better :) Give me some more time, I'll crack the code for optimism and write a detailed post about it. But I'll leave you with a hint - இதுக்கு ஒரு குருட்டுத்தனமான முட்டாள்தனமும் ஒரு முரட்டுத்தனமான புத்திசாலித்தனமும் வேணும் :) </p>
