<blockquote> â€œRemember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies." <br>
- Andy Dufresne, Shawshank Redemption</blockquote>

 <br>

<p align="justify"> I didn't realize how powerful that quote was until I experienced utter hopelessness. Have you ever been devoid of hope?  </p>

<p align="justify"> I love that quote.  Such a beautiful way to put it. Hope is a huge driving force in our lives. Regardless of how shitty the situation is, hope can show us the light at the end of the tunnel. When I look back at some of the best times of my life, I can't help but smile at how hopeful and optimistic I was. If you were to ask any of my friends or folks who've worked with me, they'd tell you that I'm cheerful, energetic and generally positive. Atleast I used to be. I love it when I'm super optimistic. I'd be zestful, overflowing with ideas, curious about everything, humourous, fun to be around, etc. </p>

<p align="justify"> But I haven't been consistently optimistic for quite a while now. The funny thing is, barring a couple of events, nothing major or traumatic happenend during this period. Slowly, over the years, I've grown to be a jaded, cynical person. I'm still hopeful about the future. But I'm quite pessimistic and unsatisfied with the present. If someone asks me what happened, all I could muster right now is "life happened". I had more exposure. I saw a large proportion of people act only in their own self-interest. A new found clarity helped me look at the life my parents and relatives led without any filters. It became crystal clear that life wasn't some game with pre-defined rules and scoring systems. You get to choose your own path and be satisfied with it. Hence, the inevitable analysis paralysis resulting from the paradox of choice. For the last 1.5 years, I've had a good professional life, but my personal life took some severe hits. Partly my own fault, partly unlucky. Nevertheless, I was floundering for a bit, made some futile attempts to escape reality and was unhappy for quite a while. I'm finally learning to live with myself and deal with the pain. </p>

<p align="justify"> The burden of responsibility and adulthood makes it hard to look at the beauty in the real world. </p>
