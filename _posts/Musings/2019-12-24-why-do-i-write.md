### I need to remember
<p align="justify"> After a long time, I rewatched the cinematic masterpiece - American Beauty. I was 18 the first time I watched it. I'm 25 now. It's amazing how much I've changed over 7 years. The first time I watched it, I thought it was a likeable, quirky dramedy. This time around though, it blew me away. I've only started to experience the grind of everyday life and I can already empathize with Lester Burnham.     </p>


I need to remember. I know it doesn't do justice to the real things. But I need something to remember
Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember...

Self-reflection

Writing your heart out is therapeutic to say the least

Articulating ideas takes significant effort, adds a much needed clarity to my thought process

Reinforces the lesson - as much as I used to pride myself on my ability to memorize random things just by reading it a couple of times, nothing drills in a lesson like writing it down
 
Easy to look up and remember what you learned the hard way

A desire to be liked and approved by people I care about and respect. I hope these posts resonate with my readers
