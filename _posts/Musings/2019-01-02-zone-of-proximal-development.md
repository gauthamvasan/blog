<p align="justify"> For a brief period in undergrad, my friends and I used to play FIFA on our laptops. It's great to have your own in-house LAN tournaments. We did it once in a while just to kill time and chill out. Did I also mention that it's a lot of fun? Anyways, I sucked big time when we started out. The good thing was all my friends sucked at it as well. It helped level the playing field. One particular hot and miserable Trichy afternoon, my roommate (Naresh) and I were playing FIFA on our own laptops against the PC. I paused my game to see how he was doing. I think he was trailing by a goal or so, but then mentioned something interesting. He was playing with the difficulty set to Professional. No wonder he was behind! Btw, I was killing it in Semi-Pro :P When I asked him why, he said sem-pro was easy and world class was too hard. So he picked a happy medium - a level which he could win at sometimes, but has to slog through to barely keep up. All this happened in a nonchalant manner. I would've probably forgotten that conversation if I hadn't tried what he said. I increased the difficulty of my games and lost way more often. But when I went to play with my friends, I was doing way better! </p>

<p align="justify"> I wish I could say I figured it out then. But no, I forgot about it for a while. I connected the dots only in the recent past. I have to tell you another story before sharing the findings :) I was talking to my boss James after we finally had some good results in our experiment. We were both relaxed and finally happy/relieved about the progress. In a casual and off-hand way, he said that he had experienced this cycle in all his projects - take up a hard project with a minimal/vague idea as to how to solve it, fail spectacularly, analyze the results, reformulate a plan, rinse and repeat until it's successful. He mentioned that it felt almost inevitable since we do not fully understand/grasp the difficulty of the problem when we start out. But once we have a better idea, we break down the task into small, solvable pieces and incrementally build upon those wins. </p>

<p align="justify"> Something clicked. I had seen the exact same pattern time and time again in my own life. Thanks to James for my eureka moment! Later, I came across an article about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">Zone of Promixal Development</a> introduced by the psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky">Lev Vygotsky</a>. </p>

<p align="justify"> According to this theory, we learn fast when guided by those who are more knowledgeable and skilled. Intuitively it  makes sense. I can personally attest to the fact that working hard with/under the guidance of smart people is the fastest way to learn. Atleast, that's the fastest way I've ever learned. Neat little theory isn't it :) In summary, break down the task into small, implementable chunks, work in a collaborative environemnt with smart folks and enjoy the process! </p>
