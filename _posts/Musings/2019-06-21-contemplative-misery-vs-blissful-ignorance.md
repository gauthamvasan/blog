<p align="justify"> <b>P.S:</b> Don't take this too seriously. I had some fun writing this post inspired by my favourite animated characters. Brownie points if you catch all the Bojack and Rick & Morty references :) </p>

<p align="justify"> The more I read, the more I experience, the more I work towards something, the more I realize how ridiculously absurd and random life can be. The illusion of control is comforting. We'd probably go mad without it. At the very least, we wouldn't be able to get anything done without it. Don't worry, this isn't some nihilist, emo rant. But it still is some kind of a rant :P Just jotting down some observations here. </p>

<p align="justify"> I proudly proclaim to people that I'm choosy about my friends. Don't get me wrong, I'm amiable. It just takes me a while to click with someone and consider them to be a close, personal friend. My mom and a lot of my family think that'd be my undoing. Apparently that makes me sound smug and arrogant. That's not what I intended, but if it helps push away people who show interest in my life purely out of monetary and selfish concerns, I believe that's mission accomplished. </p>

<p align="justify"> I'm narcissistic enough to view my own intelligence as both a powerful tool and an inescapable curse. Experience has taught me that materialistic things can't buy happiness<b><sup>1</sup></b>. I do seek external validation, but only from people I respect. And my respect is not a given just because he/she went to a good school or works for an huge MNC<b><sup>2</sup></b>. This makes it a really small circle. </p>

<p align="justify"> Class difference exists everywhere. It's subtle in the Western world. However, in India, it's just out in the open for everyone to see. My country is kinda shameless that way. I don't approve any of it. But it is what it is. I've lost count of the number of entitled idiots who believe they're superior just because they went to some reputed school or their Dad is a "big shot". They do most things out of perceived peer pressure. They go into a false sense of achievement, take pride in that and constantly pat themselves on their backs. They talk the most inane shit, discussing <i>only</i> people and objects. Unfortunately, I'm not delusional enough to believe that I'm better than others just because I wrote some code<b><sup>3</sup></b>. I don't need platitudes disguised as deep philosophy offered by some agent of averageness. Their clich√© uplifting music + "deep wisdom" seems to help a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking. That maybe appealing traits in the animals we eat. But I don't want that for myself or my friends. </p>

<p align="justify"> Now let's get to the twisted part. I seem to choose misery over blissful ignorance. Worst of all, there's some resentment associated with the fact that people I consider mediocre seem fairly happy, whereas some of my friends and I struggle to be barely functional/normal. In the end, for all my "moral" grandstanding, I'm jealous of the very people I find intolerable. </p>

<p align="justify"> The way I see it, I have 2 choices. 1) Join that group, partake in the illusion and pretend to be happy on social media, 2) Deem isolation superior, be super choosy and add to the misery :P Right now, I'd rather be miserable and contemplative than ignorant and blissful. Just might change a few years down the line. Does that make me a self-pitying masochist who fetishes his own pain? </p>


<p align="justify"> <b>Note:</b> Again, please don't take this too seriously. I myself find it kind of silly to be so self-righteous and supercilious. But still worth an effort to articulate your unfiltered thoughts. Makes life easy if you know what you're dealing with :)  </p>

<h2> Footnotes: </h2>

<p align="justify"> 1 - Watch this wonderful TED talk on the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?language=en"> longest study on happiness</a>. I make enough to lead a comfortable life. If I start earning more, I might enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Other than that, my quality of life won't change much. I'd still be interested in solving the same kind of research problems. I have before and I hopefully will continue to pick the right trade-off between money and passion. </p>

<p align="justify"> 2 - There's nothing special about working for Google, Apple, etc. Their PR team has done a great job of convincing people that being a small cog in their giant wheel somehow makes you special. Thanks to my colleagues at Kindred and my mentors at the University of Alberta, I'm very much skeptical of outlandish claims. I try not to accept something just because some authority figure said so. I was trained to be a scientist. Hence, I try to draw my own conclusions based on facts rather than faith. </p>

<p align="justify"> 3 - Many great men and women have walked on this Earth before, looked at the truth without flinching, with courage and forever changed society for the better. This life we live with all technology is their gift to us. I owe it all to these wonderful people who made this knowledge public. If I can learn it, so can anyone. There's nothing special in anything we do. Smart people are probably a plenty. A strange interplay of luck, resources, effort and intelligence ends up deciding your place in society's hierarchy. If you think solving some high school math problem makes you better than your fellow beings, you are seriously misguided. </p>
