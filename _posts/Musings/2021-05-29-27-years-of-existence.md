<p align= "justify"> According to the Gregorian Calendar, today marks 27 years of my existence on Earth. After a day filled with kind & thoughtful wishes, wonderful conversations, and fun outdoor experiences, I'm back at my apartment, looking out the window pensively, ruminating over the life I've lived so far. It's late, and I should probably go to bed. But I think I can't until I finish writing this piece. Borrowing the words of my hero <a href= "https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2015spring/before-i-go.html">Paul Kalanithi</a>, <i>I believe I've come to one of the many moments in life where I must give an account of myself, provide a ledger of what I have been, and done, and meant to the world.</i> When I was younger, I felt invincible. My whole life was ahead of me, an unending series of potentialities, which I assumed would be quite remarkable. But as I grew older, I realized that we are all forced to make hard choices. Picking one choice could mean that I was closing the door on another life story, a unique set of potentialities. And the more doors I close, the more I start to wonder how different my life could have been. If I measure my life using the naive ideals of my youth, it's hard to swallow the fact that my life has completely veered off course; my life has been nothing but a series of failures with a few minor successes interspersed in between. Compared to the contributions of the legendary men and women that walked before me, my achievements are trivial and inconsequential. In the grand scheme of things, the little feats I'm so proud of are insignificant. You could say that it's quite an unfair way to evaluate oneself, and you'd be right. Then again, I never claimed that it was reasonable or even rational to feel this way. I can't help but resonate with Jiraiya Sensei's last words on Naruto Shippuden (<a href= "https://youtu.be/qQw1e0zyOUI">The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant | The tale of Naruto Uzumaki</a>).  </p>

<blockquote> Jiraiya : [flashback] In the shinobi world, it's not how you live, it's how you die. A shinobi's life is not measured by how they live but rather it's measured by what they accomplish before their death. And looking back, my life has really been full of nothing but failure. Continually rejected by Tsunade, unable to stop my friend [about Orochimaru] and unable to protect either my student or my mentor. Compared to the great and celebrated deeds of the Hokage, my actions are trifling insignificant things indeed. I wish I could have died like each of the Hokage. A tale is only good as it's final turn of events—the plot twist. And mistakes are an important part of a plot, too. I've lived my life always believing that the lessons I learned are what honed me. I swore I'd accomplish a deed so great that it would obliterate all my failures. I'd die as a splendid shinobi. At least that's that's how it's supposed to go. But this, my plot twist, my tale ending like this... The Great Lord Elder prophesized that I would be the one to guide the revolution. A person who would make a great choice that will bring either peace or destruction to the world of the shinobi. I thought I would defeat Pain, stop the Akatsuki and save the world from destruction. But in the end, I failed that, too. How pitiful. How sad that this will be the end twist to the Tale of Jiraiya, the Gallant. What a worthless story it turned out to be. </blockquote>

<p align= "justify"> My life is very different from what I once envisioned it would be. In a way, it veered off course in an irreversibly way. People who know me think I'm bonkers for saying that. After all, I lead a privileged, moderately "successful" life. But that wasn't what I set my sights on; my sights were set much higher. I guess my brain is wired such that failures leave a much bigger mark than successes. After all, the high from a success only lasts for a bit. Once the high subsides, you're still craving for one more hit and one more after that, and it just goes on and on. But the failures, though. They're the ones that make you stay up all night, leaving deep psychological scars; the proverbial once bitten twice shy. I'm still reeling from all the blows I've accumulated over time. I think a part of me breaks on the inside with every mounting failure, and now I'm left tiptoeing around the metaphorical shards of glass, trying hard not to break down before getting through the day. </p>

<h3> Making peace with unlived lives </h3>
<p align= "justify"> The excerpt below is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Reasonable-Deviations-Beaten-Track/dp/0738206369">Perfectly Reasonabe Deviations From The Beaten Track</a>, a book of letters of Richard Feynman. It is among greatest pieces of writing I've read so far and it served as a nice, affectionate slap to my face, forcing me to rethink how I measure my life: </p>

<blockquote>
    "You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself - it is too sad a way to be. now your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naÃ¯ve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher's ideals are." 
    <br>
    - Richard P. Feynman
</blockquote>


<p align= "justify"> I've spent a significant portion of my life just mourning the person I didn't become. Through a simple twist of fate, I've been getting knocked down so frequently that it took me a while just to find my bearings again. For a long time, I was living on autopilot, tuning out my inner voice, lost and adrift at sea. I'm finally starting to wake up from the catatonic state and looking at the world as if I'm seeing it for the first time. And man, that's been a deeply spiritual, cleansing experience. I'm not yet able to fully articulate what's going on within me. But it's this strange metamorphosis that's helping let go of the bitterness, regrets, and resentments of the past. The way I'm measuring the worth of my life seems to be drastically different and way more human. I'm still lost and confused, except the heaviness of the past is being replaced by the lightness of a beginner again. And I'm perfectly fine being lost at the moment :) I'm making connections that I never could before, getting brief glimpses of the divine from time to time. It's almost as if I'm finding myself all over again, with the curiosity of a child.  </p>
    
<blockquote>
“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.”
<br> ― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth 
</blockquote>
    
<p align= "justify"> Part of this metamorphosis has to do with <i> making peace with my unlived lives.</i> For the first time in my life, I'm not chasing after the things my ego deems to be of value. I'm using a different internal signal as my compass - the rapture of feeling alive. The intellect turned out to be a lousy master and an even worse servant. The heart will man the theme, the head will man the form and function. I don't want to be one of the men targeted by this quote often attributed to Ben Franklin: "Most people die at 25 and aren't buried until they're 75." I intend to write another post in a few years, talking about this new journey. I hope I'll rekindle the adventurous and free-spirited nature of mine, something we all had as kids. And I hope that you can find it in you to smile like our future Pirate King <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy">Monkey D Luffy</a> :)      </p>
