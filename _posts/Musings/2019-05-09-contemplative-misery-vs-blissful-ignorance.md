They go into a false sense of achievement, take pride in that and constantly pat themselves on their backs. They talk the most inane shit, discussing only people and objects. The way I see it, we have 2 choices. 1) Join that group, partake in the illusion and pretend to be happy on social media, 2) Deem isolation superior, be super choosy and add to the misery :P Right now, I'd rather be miserable and contemplative than ignorant and blissful. Just might change a few years down the line.

<p align="justify"> I'm narcissistic enough to view my own intelligence as both a powerful tool and an inescapable curse. Experience has taught me that materialistic things can't buy happiness<sup>1</sup>. I do seek external validation, but only from people I respect<sup>2</sup>. This makes it a really small circle. Unfortunately, I'm not delusional enough to believe that I'm better than others just because I wrote some code<sup>3</sup>. I don't need platitudes disguised as deep philosophy offered by some agent of averageness. Their cliched uplifting music + "deep wisdom" seems to help a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking. But I seem to choose misery over blissful ignorance. Worst of all, there's some resentment associated with the fact that people I consider to be mediocre seem fairly happy, whereas some of my friends and I struggle to be barely functional/normal. </p>

<h2> Footnotes: </h2>

<p align="justify"> 1 - Watch this wonderful TED talk on the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?language=en"> longest study on happiness</a>. I make enough to lead a comfortable life. If I start earning more, I might enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Other than that, my quality of life won't change much. I'd still be interested in solving the same kind of research problems. I have before and I hopefully will continue to pick the right trade-off between money and passion. </p>

<p align="justify"> 2 - There's nothing special about working for Google, Apple, etc. Their PR team has done a great job of convincing people that being a small cog in their giant wheel somehow makes you special. Thanks to my colleagues at Kindred and my mentors at the University of Alberta, I'm very much skeptical of outlandish claims. I try not to accept something just because some authority figure said so. I was trained to be a scientist. Hence, I try to draw my own conclusions based on facts rather than faith. </p>

<p align="justify"> 3 - Many great men and women have walked on this Earth before, looked at the truth without flinching, with courage and forever changed society for the better. This life we live with all technology is their gift to us. I owe it all to these wonderful people who made this knowledge public. If I can learn it, so can anyone. There's nothing special in anything we do. Smart people are probably a plenty. A strange interplay of luck, resources, effort and intelligence ends up deciding your place in society's hierarchy. If you think solving some high school math problem makes you better than your fellow beings, you are seriously misguided. </p>
