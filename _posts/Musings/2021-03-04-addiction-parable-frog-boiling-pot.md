<p align="justify"> As a kid, it hardly ever crossed my mind that life could suck. I had a typical, average Indian middle class childhood, yet it was filled with happiness and a sense of adventure. The world was my oyster and I, it's rightful master; Well, at least that's what I thought thanks to my youthful optimism and naivete. Of course, if you ask the people who knew me back in my childhood, they'd tell you I spent it with my head in the clouds. All I can do now is smile, reminiscing about how blissfully ignorant I was. If you're lucky, you're born into a loving, caring family that shields you from from the brutal elements of reality; atleast until you're an adult. Now that it's almost 10 years since I graduated from high school, life's starting to hit a little different. The past few years have been especially rough with the loss of my father, break-ups, failed dreams, friendships growing apart and a littany of other reasons. Don't worry, this is not some sad story where I keep whining, asking you to take pity on me. I don't see myself as a victim. Recently, I had some time to re-evaluate my life take a really  good, hard, sober look at myself and the lives of loved ones. It led me to write this rambling, somewhat cohesive take on depression, addiction, and the blessing/curse of intelligence. </p>

<h3> Intelligence: a pricless gift or an inescapable curse? </h3>

<p align="justify"> Barring people with faulty/malfunctioning neural circuits, every depressed person would agree that they're rotting away at the hands of their own mind. It's our own mind that doesn't let us retain a semblance of peace and sanity. Since time immemorial, sentient beings have tried their best to turn off their conscious mind and revel in hedonistic pleasure. Humans ingest a variety of designer drugs meant to alter our perceptions and experiences. These drugs have varying effects, potencies and addictive propensities. We try our best to forget and escape reality. But however hard we try, we can never seem to escape it. Regardless  of how fast we run, our inner demons always have a way of catching up with us. At best, our efforts to escape reality with drugs are like an ostrich burying its head in the sand and pretending that everything is alright.     </p>

<p align="justify"> People do drugs for a whole host of reasons. But most people who use it as a coping mechanism do it for one primary reason - to tune out that obsessive, nagging voice in their head. The voice that torments you about past mistakes, regrets, what-ifs and if-onlys. Reality is either too painful or there's an emotional blackhole that sucks in every ounce of positivity within. What do you do when being alone with your own thoughts is just awful? What do you do when you seem to have no control over the thoughts you have? What do you do when your own mind spirals out of control, obssessively ruminating over past mistakes and trauma, ruthlessly judging you and making you feel like a worthless, miserable piece of shit? Well, I don't know the answer. But I do know that it's a long, torturous road ahead to get back to "normalcy". </p>
    
<p align="justify"> If you are in the mood for a biblical metaphor, what I've described so far is akin to entering the belly of the whale. Some people are lucky and diligent enough to climb out of the belly of the whale and emerge stronger. Some barely make it, with scars that last a life time. And others are forever trapped, haunted by their past, drowning their sorrows with a poison of their choice. Unable to face reality, they either distract themselves with relatively mild addictions like food, TV, video games, etc., or jump off the deep end into more serious stuff like alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, etc. If you ask them why, the answer is simple. In their mind, it's less painful than staying sober. They can escape reality and tune out the ruthlessly self-critical voices in their head and live in their <i>artifical paradise</i>, if only for a few hours everyday. But is the price of such air castles worth the rotting degradation of the mind? The answer varies depending on whom you ask the question. After all, some people are so far gone that they'd rather die in their artificial paradise than risk coming back to reality. </p>

<p align="justify"> Okay, so this isn't some cautionary tale about the horrors of addiction or some preachy moralistic story meant to scare you straight from any and all drugs. It's all fine and dandy when you are happy and well-adjusted. It's easy to check your impulses and habits when you are happy and well-adjusted. But if you start turning to the bottle or other drugs as a coping/escape mechanism, it's a slippery slope my friend. Initially, you do it just once in a blue moon to relieve the pain, de-stress, and just unwind for the night. But once your brain starts to strongly associate the drug with escape and pleasure, life spirals out of control in what feels a blink of an eye; so much so that you are left wondering how the hell did everything good turn to dust so fast. </p>

<p align="justify"> As with all tricks of the devil, there's a catch. Drugs are only a short-term fix. With every use, you slip further and further into a dark pit. I guess the parable of the boiling frog fits it best:  </p>  

<blockquote>
"Suppose you want to boil a frog. How do you do it? You could place the frog into a pot of hot water, but as soon as it feels the heat, it will jump out. So, what can you do? Put a pot of cool water on the stove and then add the frog. Not sensing danger the frog will stay. Next, turn the burner on low to slowly heat the water. As the water warms, the frog relaxes. The warmth feels good. As the water gets hotter it acts like a steam bath draining away energy and deepening the frog's relaxation. The frog becomes sleepy and has less and less energy while the water is getting hotter and hotter. By the time the frog realizes its danger, the water is beginning to boil, and it is too late to take action. There is neither time nor energy left to do anything. The frog perishes in the boiling water."
</blockquote>


<p align="justify"> We can debate the biological plausibility of this parable all night. But that's beside the point. The message is pretty clear - Be vigilant and self-aware. Changes slowly creep up on you, at a barely perceptible pace. Don't become a "boiled frog." Pay close attention to what is going on inside your head and outside your body, so that you can notice when the "water" is getting hot. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
    We are all born into a world where we're forced to contemplate our own mortality and powerlessness. While the circumstances leading up to it are fairly diverse, we are all forced to face this aspect of reality at different points in our lives. Such experiences lead us to question everything we took for granted, our entire belief systems. When our expectation/understanding of reality doesn't match "true" reality, we start experiencing internal chaos, which can be an unbelievably excruciating ordeal. It can result in an existential crisis, leading you to question your very existence, meaning and purpose in life. If you're self-aware, you'd notice the abyss, the dark void inside you. The void has a way of drawing you closer to it, so close that you can't help but stare into the abyss. The question is whether you are able to handle the abyss staring back without blinking? Well, I blinked. As brief as it was, I blinked nevertheless. The pain I endured, the lessons I learned and the scars I bear are a consequence of such fateful moments :) It taught me a valuable lesson - Be wary of the artificial paradises that life has to offer.

## Side Note

<p align="justify"> This isn't explicitly related to this post, but this brilliant scene from Rick and Morty provided me with much needed clarity during a difficult time in my life. If you're struggling with your inner demons, feel free to reach out to me or get professional help. Maybe, just maybe, this scene would help you as much as it helped me get better.  </p>

"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. <br>
    You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. <br>
    And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.<br>
You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. <br>
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. <br> 
    And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. "
