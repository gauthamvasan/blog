<blockquote> <b>Sciolist</b> - a person who pretends to be knowledgeable and well informed. </blockquote>

<p align="justify"> I was listening to <a href="http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/naval-ravikant">this</a> Joe Rogan podcast with Naval Ravikant recently. It's an incredible conversation packed with deep insights. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=7710">2:08:31</a>, they briefly touch upon this act of sounding smart instead of being smart. That hit a nerve since I'm quite guilty of that. Mostly it's just little white lies, but on other occassions, it's either a variant of <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> or a futile, vain desire to maintain an image for society. </p>

<p align="justify"> As a kid, I loved the attention that my teachers showered on me; And I ate it up like a kid in a candy store. I was a well-behaved child who was academically inclined. My identity revolved around being the smart one in class. Hence I'd do what was necessary to maintain that image. If the teacher posed a question to the class, my hand would be up, eager to impress everyone with my answer. If it was a question that needed some mathematical calculations, I'd frantically try and solve it as fast as possible. It was (and still is to an extent) extremely important to me that I got the answer first. I saw first-hand the respect an educated, successful man garnered and I really, really wanted that. I grew up hearing the Tamil aphorism "கற்றோருக்கு செல்லும் இடமெல்லாம் சிறப்பு" roughly translated as "The learned men garner respect everywhere they go". While the desire to learn is definitely worthwhile, I've employed questionable means to achieve that end. </p>

<p align="justify"> A post-mortem analysis of my sustained academic efforts revealed two predominant, underlying intentions:</p>
1. A genuine desire to learn something (internal)
2. A dubious desire to project a self-image to society (external)
<p align="justify"> Interestingly, if I picked an activity with the sole purpose of impressing a third person, it never panned out. It left me feeling like an impostor whose lies deserved to be exposed to the whole world. I wouldn't actively work on such projects and rather focus on hacks & easy wins that help project the external image. </p>

## Hacks, quick fixes and other examples of feigning smartness

### Memorization & rote learning

<p align="justify"> This problem of rote learning is so rampant across the Indian education system that it's not even funny anymore. Most of my exams involved memorizing ungodly amounts of text, formulas, diagrams, equations, etc., and subsequently reproducing them in an examination. There's a colossal tutoring & publishing industry dedicated to identifying chapter-wise "important" questions. These are frequently asked test questions that students should memorize in order to get good marks in board exams. If you have a decent memory, chances are you're going to do well in these exams. After 14 years of schooling and 4 years of undergrad in a system deeply entrenched with rote learning at its core, I learned this - <u>I knew shit about shit</u>. To be fair, thanks to my high school teachers, I did know the difference between rote learning and <i>understanding the concepts</i>. However, that didn't stop me from employing hacks and memorizing "important" topics to score well in exams. I wish I could say I truly understood the subject first and later memorized the relevant topics to game the system. Truth is I did just enough to maintain a respectable grade point average (GPA). Afterall, a high GPA had immediate short-term rewards; it "showed" that you were smart and studious, it increased the probability of internships and job offers. Of course, a stellar GPA in a system that incentivizes thinking and understanding, a high GPA is laudable. But metrics like grades turn meaningless if all one has to do is cram, memorize, regurgitate and forget. </p>    

<blockquote> “You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. <b> I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.</b>”
    <br>
― Richard P. Feynman, "What Do You Care What Other People Think?"  </blockquote>  

<p align="justify"> Absorbing information without understanding stunted my growth as a researcher. It led to underdevelopment of skills like analyzing, critiquing and learning on my own. Content memorization does have its place in learning. For example, multiplication tables accelerate mental arithmetic speeds. On a lighter note, I'd definitely prefer a doctor who could diagnose existing conditions off the top of his/her head over someone who looks up symptoms on WebMD. Having useful information in your fingertips is definitely of great use in personal and professional settings. But recollection of facts shouldn't take precedence over the development of reasoning abilities.    </p>

<p align="justify"> P.S: Richard Feynman famously admonished the rote learning system in Brazilian universities in a keynote speech titled <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/46/2/LatinAmerica.htm">The Problem of Teaching Physics in Latin America</a>. A first person account of the events from Feynman's biography can be found <a href="{{site.url}}/random/feynman-on-brazilian-education-system//">here</a>.  </p>

### Pawning off someone else's insights and passing it off as your own original thought
<p align="justify">"My Boy is Wicked Smart", the scene that spawned a thousand pop culture references: </p>

<center> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIdsjNGCGz4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

<p align="justify"> You'd be surprised if you knew the sheer amount of educated tools like the blonde guy with a ponytail from that iconic scene. I have no doubt that folks like him are clever. But their desire to show off and prove their "superior" intellect is so blinding that it drives out any sense of humilty and openness required for original thoughts. This strategy is insidious in the sense that it's very hard to unlearn. Under the right circumstances, it would definitely lead to moderate financial success. But this is a horrible strategy is you are intent on creating something new. In other words, it's a great example of "winning the battle but losing the war."   </p>

### Getting on the hype-train / Fear of missing out 
<p align="justify"> Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing. These are just a few examples of fields that were hyped way too much in the past. I still vividly remember a LOT of asinine posts and talks about the perils of AI and how AI would revolutize the world from folks who had zero background in AI. While the experts carefully measured their words, the halfwits shot their mouth off. "Empty vessels make the most noise". This aphorism holds true especially during the publicity frenzy. I get the desire to cash in on the next big thing. Venture capital is based on just that. But using buzzwords to make yourself sound smarter is a strategy guaranteed to blow up in your face. Your friends and connections on social media might like a few of your mindless posts. But the professionals would notice the pretentious nature of the enterprise. True experts in the subject matter wouldn't associate with you. </p>

### Virtue signalling
<p align="justify"> "People who do X are considered smart. Therefore if I do X, I'm also smart." Now replace X with activities like reading classics, business books, biographies, etc. This sort of "infallible" reasoning leads to a lot of annoying, narcissistic behavior, especially on social media. LinkedIn would be exhibit A. LinkedIn is full of people who pass off banal platitudes disguised as deep philosophy. This category feeds on social media validation and derive pleasure from being a garden-variety phony. The external projected self is more important than the actual self. They're the ones who post with hashtags like (#learning, #Xisthefuture, #success, #inspiration, etc.) </p>

<p align="justify"> Maybe it's just me. But my social media feed is flooded with inane posts by pretentious dickwads who distort their privileged life experiences into something inspirational. Are we seriously supposed to be inspired by their meaningless accomplishments and like their posts to encourage their nauseating, constant need for approval? In the legendary words of George Carlin, I want to say to those folks - "go fuck yourself".  </p>

### Humble brag: The curious case of false humility
<p align="justify"> I'm sure that we all know folks who consciously try to get away with bragging about themself by masking it with a phony show of humility. And it's almost always about IQ or money. They might speak in an eloquent, articulate fashion. But they would surreptitiously add that they don't find people to connect with because they're just too damn smart.  </p>


<p align="justify"> </p>


### Using technical jargon to explain other jargon

"Basically the constitution of the constipation of the wash basin of the brownian motion..."   

<p align="justify"> </p>
Trying to pretend I understand the math in a hardcore presentation

Trying to impress peers with unnecessary technical jargon instead of simple, intuitive explanations

Impressed by others when they say something extremely complex that I don't undersand. 

### Pretending to understand X rather than admitting you don't

## Optimizing for the primary objective instead of surrogate objectives





<p align="justify"> </p>



Why do we focus on shortcut surrogate objectives?

Smartness is a state of being. Sounding smart is a byproduct of the process. Instead of focusing on the main objective, we end up optimizing for surrogate objectives that give us immediate rewards, but are harmful/limiting in the long run
