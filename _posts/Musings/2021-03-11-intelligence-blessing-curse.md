<p align="justify"> For a long time, I was struggling with this question - <i>Is intelligence a blessing or a curse?</i>. I couldn't help but see it as a double-edged sword, that can have significantly unfavorable consequences. After all, pop-culture glorifies the story/myth of the troubled genius. The myth has some grounding in reality, given studies and experience seem to indicate correlations between intelligence, addiction and depression. The real trouble starts when we start to narcissistically associate our own intellect as a primary cause of depression/addiction. After all, if we are to believe society's perception of the problem, the resulting depression/addicition seems inevitable. Yet, that is not true. I've come to realize that the misconception stems from erroneously conflating wisdom with intellect and knowledge with understanding. I don't have enough clarity to clearly articulate the cause and effect of the problem. But it took me a personal attack/slap on the face in the form a brilliant scene from Rick and Morty to wake up to reality and take positive steps towards a mindful life rather than masochistically fetishizing my own pain:   </p> <br>

<blockquote>
"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. <br>
    <b>You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. <br>
    And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. </b> <br>
    <b>You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle. </b> <br>
You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  <br> <br> 
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. <br> 
    And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. "
