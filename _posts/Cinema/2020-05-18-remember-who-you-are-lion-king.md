<p align="justify"> The Lion King is hands down one of the best movies ever made. One of the earliest memories in my life is watching The Lion King on a big clunky BPL brand CRT television using a large VCD player. The vivid colors, the picturesque artwork depicting the savannah, the iconic sountrack (especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiNy4d4gc">Circle of Life</a>) are still fresh in my mind! I still remember my Dad bring in the Lion King VCD and set it up for me and my brother. Now that he's gone, this conversation is particularly dear to me. </p>


<blockquote>
<b>Mufasa:</b> You have forgotten who you are, and so forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the Circle of Life.

<br> <br>

<b>Simba:</b> How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.

<br> <br>

<b>Mufasa:</b> Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true King. Remember who you are.
