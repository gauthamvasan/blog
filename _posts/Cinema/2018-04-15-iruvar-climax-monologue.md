<p align="justify"> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iruvar">Iruvar</a> is his best film till date (read <a href="https://baradwajrangan.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/coming-soon/">Baradwaj Rangan's Conversations with Mani Ratnam</a>). While I personally rate Nayakan, Anjali, Kannathil Muthamittal and Mouna Ragam over Iruvar, Prakash Raj's Tamizhselvan is tied first for my favorite Mani Ratnam character. Prakash Raj is just sublime in his portrayal of Karunanidhi (the movie claimed otherwise due to political concerns). I just love the scene where an emotional Tamizhselvan recites poetry mourning his friend's death (Anandan/MGR portrayed by Mohan Lal) and indirectly conveys the depth of their friendship. For an amazing translation of the climax monologue - <a href="http://www.lyricaldelights.com/2016/03/11/iruvar-climax-monologue-lyrics-and-translation/">post by Lyrical Delights</a>.</p>
