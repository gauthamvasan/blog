<p align="justify"> <br> One of the best scenes ever in the history of cinema. Thank you Pixar for making this amazing movie. No words, just a pantomime opening sequence that shatters all the familiar tropes of happy, go-lucky animation stories. The scene is so hauntingly beautiful that I can see reflections of myself or my dear ones in its characters and story. A montage of the pair's married life set to a soulful tune just breaks my heart; every single time. Stupid mosquito, flew right into my eye...   </p>

<p> Signing off, <br>
