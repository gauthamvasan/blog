<p align="justify"> My article recently got published in The Hindu Education Plus! Yay! I guess I intended it as a publicity piece for the University of Alberta and in retrospect, I was showing off a bit. 
Regardless, you can find the article here - <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/gauthan-vasan-shares-his-fascination-for-creating-intelligent-artificial-limbs-at-the-university-of-alberta/article9012039.ece" target = "_blank"> Hindu article </a> </p>

<p align="justify"> To those of you who are unfamiliar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu" target="_blank"> The Hindu </a>, It is an Indian daily newspaper in English. It's revered for its serious journalism and great writing. In 1965, The Times listed The Hindu as one of the world's ten best newspapers. I personally consider The Hindu as the only reliable news source to understand and analyze Indian news and politics. </p>
