I spent 4 of my formative years at the <a href="https://www.nitt.edu/">National Institute of Technology, Trichy</a>. To paraphrase Charles Dickens, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. I had lifelong friends and handled responbilities that would be unimaginable anywhere else. While I have a lot of fond memories and positive things to say, I also have a lot of complaints. 

<a href="https://feedsnitt.com"> Feeds</a>, the official college magazine of NIT Trichy got in touch with me for a 1-1 interview and I had a great time chatting with the team. It felt great to be featured in my alma mater's college magazine:D Funnily enough, thanks to my brutal honesty in some portions, the team had to include a disclaimer! (Important to note that none of the other interviews had a disclaimer!)
