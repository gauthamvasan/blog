Tina Fey is ... funny :) Full disclosure - before reading this book, I had no idea who Tine Fey is. I just read the book since a lot of the people I follow on goodreads seemed to like it. I liked the fact that she didn't take herself too seriously in the book. It was mostly silly, tongue-in-cheek humour that makes you chuckle. A quick, light-hearted read that feels like a chat with a friend over beer. 

Rating: 3.5/5
