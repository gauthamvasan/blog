<blockquote> ‘எப்படி வாழவேண்டும்?’ என்பதற்கு இது நூலல்ல; ‘எப்படி வாழக்கூடாது!’ என்பதற்கு இதுவே வழிகாட்டி.
ஒரு பெரிய அரசியல் தலைவனின் வரலாறுமல்ல இது; ஒரு மாபெரும் கவிஞனின் காவிய வாழ்க்கையுமல்ல இது. வாழ்க்கை வழிப்போக்கன் ஒருவனின் உயர்வு, தாழ்வுகளே இந்நூல். </blockquote>

<p align="justify"> What a great thing to say in the introduction. Right off the bat, he's indicating that he's lived an interesting life filled with mistakes. It's not some weird narcissitic pride thing like the movie Sanju. Rather, he says it in a casual, off-hand, matter of fact way. And his reasoning for doing so is perfect - "காந்தி அடிகளின் சுயசரிதத்தைப் படித்த பின்பு, இதனை எழுதியதால், உண்மையை நிர்வாணமாகக் கூறுவதில் அதிக ஆசை எழுந்தது." (Translation: He read Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography and felt like being honest )  </p>

<p align="justify"> Dying men are honest. They've got nothing to lose (except maybe their legacy?). I can understand the honesty of someone like Paul Kalanithi. But this guy goes rogue when he's got everything to lose! He talks about his hedonistic side - lechery, drunken debauchery, drugs, you name it! The things he talks about openly are still a huge taboo in India, controversial in the Western world. I still fear talking like that. Yet this guy goes ahead and does this right from the 50s! What a man!  </p>

<p align="justify"> I started this book right after When Breath Becomes Air. It was a strange choice. But I was looking for honest writing. This was a book my Dad recommended. I've always heard a lot about Kannadasan. He's a legend among the Tamil diaspora. But if you ask me to name a single song penned by him, I'd draw a blank. Nevertheless, I've been curious about Tamil icons for a while now. I definitely made the right choice picking this book. It brings to life a different time in TN. The rise of DMK has always been fascinating to me. Though I vehemently disagree with their ideals, I still respect their meteoric rise to political power. Karunanidhi and Anna Durai changed the political landscape of TN forever. They've managed to etch their names in history. Getting the inside scoop from someone like Kannadasan is just amazing to say the least.  </p>

<p align="justify"> I got intrigued just by the preface. I remember thinking that it'd shape up to be an extraordinary book. And it did!

He's humble enough to think he hasn't achieved much in life. Paints a beautiful picture of a flawed man. His Dad with some amazing qualities, but also a huge self-destructive tendency as a gambling addict, a sweet, strong mom who was a prisoner of her times, collateral damage to his Dad's antics. Reminiscent of Iraivi and my own life experiences. Brilliant as a kid, good at studies, but always getting into trouble and mischievous. Ends preface with something his hostel warden said when he graduated from 8th grade - "Nee enga ponalum urupadave maata"

Interesting approach to write your own life story as a 3rd person account. A story instead of life recounts. naan endru ezhutha vendiya idangalil avan. arputhamaga irukkirathu.

Karunanithi demolished - stories involving multiple prostitutes. DMK not paying hookers, Karunanithi writing about a father raping a daughter in "thullu tamizh" :P

Was this story about Anna durai - a girl dressed as a guy to enter the party HQ and spend the night with him.
