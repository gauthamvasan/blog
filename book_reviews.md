<p align="justify"> I usually write reviews for books I love or loathe. If you want to understand my motivation behind writing reviews, read this <a href="{{site.url}}/musings/why-book-reviews">post</a>. Relatively succinct reviews and a list of books I read can be found on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29446357-gautham-vasan" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>. Feel free to browse through my old reviews and book shelves! </p>
