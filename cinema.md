<p align="justify"> Cinema is an extremely difficult art form to master. While some pander to the audience in the hopes of making big bucks, the actors/filmmakers/technicians who transcend generations submit themselves completely to the art. They're the ones who create stunning works of genius and creativity. They invoke a motley of emotions, they have stories to tell. In this part of my blog, I intend to talk about my favourite moments in films, TV shows, cartoons, anime, etc. </p>
