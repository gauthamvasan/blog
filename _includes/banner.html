        <h1>A Digital Pensieve For My Analog Brain</h1>

        Ever so slowly, the waves of time chip away at the immense edifice of memory. I've come to a realization that memories can be fickle. While some emotional highs and lows tend to stick around for a long time, others simply fade into oblivion. And then we have our own <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/simon-heffer-proust-madeleine-wagner/">"madeleine moments"</a>. Once in a blue moon, an article, an old song or a familiar smell could evoke vivid, wonderful memories of the people and places from the past. A trigger so powerful that the mental recall experience is effortless. So here I am, an amateur writer trying to undertake the Sisyphean task of chronicling my musings and ruminations at different points in my life. Someday in the future, when I look back at my old posts, they just might spark memories in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory#Marcel_Proust%E2%80%94Proustian_memory">Proustian</a> rush.

        I intend to treat this blog as my personal <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve">pensieve</a> - an "accurate" description of various events, my thoughts and things that had a significant impact on me. Some posts might be interesting, others not so much. Either way, things I deem worthy would go into the pensieve.

        I belong to a generation who are sometimes disparagingly referred to as "Millenials". Some common stereotypes include the belief that my generation is lazy, petulant, has a narcisstic obsession with social image and exhibits a constant need for attention and approval. While I don't necessarily agree with this portrayal, I do witness such behavior (mostly on social media). The quality of conversations have been steadily declining on popular platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, etc. These giants consciously exploited behavioral psychology in a concerted effort to maximize the time spent by a user on their sites. Hence, I try to stay away from online social media as much as possible. This blog is partly an attempt to satisfy my need for approval from like-minded people and/or people I respect. At the end of the day, I still am a social animal. I consider myself to be smart, but judge for yourself. Afterall, I could be yet another case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. Hopefully, you'd find something funny/worthwhile to read here :)
