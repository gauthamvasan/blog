        In the vast tapestry of life, my existence feels like delicate footprints imprinted on a sandy beach, beautiful precisely because it's ephemeral. 
        Time, much like water, has the power to gently erode the marks I leave behind. 
        The things I've done and the memories I've created might not stick around forever. 
        But I still go on leaving a trace, just so I can someday say to myself, 'I was here :)'.

    <p align="justify"> 
        In the constant ebb and flow of life, I find comfort in accepting that the beauty lies in the fleeting moments. 
        This blog is in some sense a quixotic attempt to make sense of and capture fleeting moments in my life.
        Most likely, it'll be a tiny snapshot that, for an infinitesimal second, encapsulates something about my existence, be it essence or nonsense.

        I'm not sure what series of events brought you to my blog, but I'm genuinely delighted that you've made it this far. 
        I trust you'll stumble upon something here that resonates, whether it's something relatable, healing, or simply brings a silly smile to your face. 
        I wish you the best of luck and I hope you find what you are looking for. 
        And if may overstep my bounds just a little, I urge you to take a moment to gaze at the starry night sky â€” losing yourself once again in the magnificent splendor of the Universe. 
        Farewell for now, until we meet again &#128075; 
    </p>
