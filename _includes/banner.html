        <h1>A Digital Pensieve For My Analog Brain</h1>

        Ever so slowly, the waves of time chip away at the immense edifice of memory. I've come to a realization that memories can be fickle. While some emotional highs and lows tend to stick around for a long time, others simply fade into oblivion. And then we have our own <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/simon-heffer-proust-madeleine-wagner/">"madeleine moments"</a>. Once in a blue moon, an article, an old song or a familiar smell could evoke vivid, wonderful memories of the people and places from the past. A trigger so powerful that the mental recall experience is effortless. So here I am, an amateur writer trying to undertake the Sisyphean task of chronicling my musings and ruminations at different points in my life. Someday in the future, when I look back at my old posts, they just might spark memories in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_memory#Marcel_Proust%E2%80%94Proustian_memory">Proustian</a> rush.

        I intend to treat this blog as my personal pensieve - an "accurate" description of various events, my thoughts and things that had a significant impact on me. Some posts might be interesting, others not so much. Either way, things I deem worthy would go into the pensieve.

        I belong to a generation who are sometimes disparagingly referred to as the "Millenials". Common stereotypes include - selfie-obsessed, attention seeking, whiny, lazy, etc. While I don't necessarily agree with description, I do on occasion witness such behavior (mostly on social media). I honestly believe that social media is making us stupid. I could feel my IQ drop a couple of points when I'm on buzzfeed, etc. The quality of conversations have been steadily declining on popular platforms. Facebook, snapchat, etc., have consciously exploited human behavioral psychology to get us addicted. Hence, I try to stay away from social media as much as possible. This blog is partly an attempt to satisfy my need for approval from like-minded people and/or people I respect. At the end of the day, I still am a social animal. I consider myself to be smart, but judge for yourself. Afterall, I could be yet another case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Hopefully, you'd find something funny/worthwhile to read here :)
