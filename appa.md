My Dad was an extraordinary man. It'd be an understatement to say that it was a huge blow when he passed away on June 30th, 2019 around 8:38 PM IST. Even though he was unconscious, I atleast got a chance to see him, touch him and finally say goodbye before he passed on. I intend to write about my Dad, memories involving him, my observations about life and my futile attempts to attain some semblance of acceptance. I strongly believe that we all learn to deal with pain in different ways. Our coping mechanisms are heavily dependent on our beliefs, support systems and circumstances. Simply put, what works for one may not work for another. Unlike material losses, we never overcome the loss of a loved one. We just find ways to live with it. What little I've achieved so far and whatever I achieve in the future, I owe it all to my loving father, Vasan Ramadoss. If there exists an afterlife, I hope he's happy there.
