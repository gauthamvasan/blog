<p align="justify"> Off late, I've been getting a lot of emails and fb messages from prospective grad students in India. It's usually related to advice on grad programs, statement of purpose, etc. Please note that fb messages from strangers get filtered and there's a good chance I won't see them. I've decided to compile some generic replies and comments about the application process and higher studies experience that might be useful.

<b>P.S:</b> Due to time constraints, I might not reply to queries immediately. That said, please email me and I'll try my best to be helpful. </p>
