<p align="justify"> Think. Speak. Write. This section of my blog is partly an exercise in critical thinking. I find value in clearly articulating my ideas in written form. Here's a <a href="{{site.url}}/musings/why-do-i-write">post</a> that explains why <u>I</u> write. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/x0vUsxhMczI">video</a> that elucidates why <u>you</u> should write. I mostly write in the first person and refrain from blanket statements and generalizations. My individual experiences wouldn't necessarily scale to a larger class of individuals; they may or may not apply to your situation. But I find personal stories better suited for engaging, impactful content compared to vague, impersonal reflections. </p>
