<p align="justify"> Traveling is food for the soul. It helps expand my horizons and revel in the smaller pleasures of life. As a species, humankind suffers from a compulsive urge to travel. I'll try my best to document my physical exploration in a digital world. That said, I'm not a travel blogger. I don't use instagram and avoid most social media platforms. Hence I've made peace with the fact that this section of the blog would be woefully inadequate when it comes to what I see versus what I jot down. </p>
