<p align="justify"> Tamil is one of the seven classical languages. It's one of the oldest surviving languages in the world and has unbelievably dense and beautiful literary works. Unfortunately, I'm still a novice in this area. I'm going to try something new to me - I'm going to post lyrics and poems in Tamil and attempt to convey its meaning. These won't be exact translations. Remember those shitty subtitles which lack the context, subtlety and finesse? My translations would be slightly better than that :P </p>
